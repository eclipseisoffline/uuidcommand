## Usage

Mod builds can be found on the releases page, as well as on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/uuid-command).

The Fabric API is required. This mod is both supported on the server and on the client:

- When installed on the server, any OP-ed players are able to use the `/uuid` command, even if they don't have the mod installed client side.
- When installed on the client, you can use the `/uuid` command in single- and multiplayer, even if you don't have OP permissions.
  - On multiplayer, the command is only able to fetch the UUIDs of entities in render distance and all players. 

Command syntax:

- `/uuid <entity>` - displays the UUID of the given entity.
